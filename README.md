# TickerWidget for Flutter

A ticker widget for Flutter. The widget accepts any `Tile` and repeats it as much as needed.

The widget scrolls exactly tile-length and then resets the position so it looks like the view is continuously scrolling. 

The animation duration field is the speed at which one tile scrolls across. So that speed will change based on the length of the tile
